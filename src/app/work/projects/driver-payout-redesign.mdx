## About the Project

2â€™lNorth is a pioneering concept in the Indian Auto After Sales Industry, addressing the challenge vehicle owners face in finding trustworthy service providers. The Driver Onboarding Application was developed to digitize the recruitment process for ambassadors (drivers and technicians), replacing manual paperwork with a streamlined digital solution.

## Objectives

- Replace the inefficient pen-and-paper recruitment process with a digital tool
- Track and reduce ambassador dropout rates by identifying key reasons for attrition
- Provide recruiters, trainers, and stakeholders with a centralized platform for data management and evaluation

## Goals

- Eliminate manual data entry and reduce errors in the recruitment process
- Improve retention rates by analyzing dropout reasons and ambassador backgrounds
- Enhance efficiency for recruiters and trainers through intuitive interfaces and dashboards

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was transitioning from a manual system to a digital platform while maintaining usability across all user groups (recruiters, trainers, and ambassadors).  
Key learnings included:

- Conducting user interviews and card sorting helped uncover usability gaps
- Iterative testing ensured a seamless experience for non-tech-savvy users
- Designing a data-rich dashboard required strong visual hierarchy and narrative thinking to convert complex insights into clear action points

## Outcome

The onboarding tool successfully digitized the entire recruitment process, eliminating paperwork and improving data accuracy.  
Highlights include:

- Enhanced recruiter and trainer efficiency
- Dashboard analytics exposed key trends and dropout causes
- Foundation laid for future enhancements like predictive hiring models

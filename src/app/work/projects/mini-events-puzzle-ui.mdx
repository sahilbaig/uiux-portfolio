## About the game

This mini-event feature was designed for a casual, free-to-play word puzzle game with a wide player base aged 25-44. The core goal was to introduce time-based, light competition events as a refreshing alternative to the main gameplay, while enhancing engagement.

## Objectives

- Create short, time-limited puzzle events that feel fun, light, and rewarding
- Introduce competition with leaderboards to appeal to social and challenge-driven players
- Drive higher daily engagement without cannibalizing the core game loop

## Goals

- Increase overall player activity and session frequency through short bursts of competition
- Offer variety and freshness to the gameplay through alternate mini-event formats
- Capture additional monetization opportunities via ticket systems and urgency-based mechanics

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Discovery & Research:** Explored mini-event mechanics from similar word games like Wordzee, Boggle, Scrabble Go, and Trivia Crack. Key patterns included dedicated event tabs, reward loops, and social competition.
- **User Behavior:** Players enjoyed short-term challenges but found limited ticket availability and time pressure frustrating. This highlighted the need for balance between urgency and accessibility.
- **UI/UX Learnings:** Emphasis on surfacing events prominently, simplifying entry steps, and aligning puzzle tile UI with game visual language improved participation.
- **Persona Insights:** Socializers dominated the user baseâ€”motivated by leaderboards, sharing, and recognition. The feature design reflected these needs with FOMO triggers, streak incentives, and shareable wins.

## Outcome

- Event placement in bottom nav led to better visibility and smoother access
- Usability testing validated top-aligned timer/score placement for lower cognitive load
- Mixed reviews initially ("not crossword", "boring", "tickets unavailable") led to ongoing iterations
- Early versions delivered a **3% LTV increase**, with ongoing experiments and flow updates in progress

## About the game

Daily Themed Crossword is a casual, free-to-play crossword puzzle game launched in January 2018. It has amassed over 10 million downloads and has 600k+ DAU across Android and iOS platforms.

## Objectives

- Increase engagement with non-daily puzzles, especially the underutilized featured puzzle section
- Reduce cannibalization caused by the third daily puzzle and provide players with a compelling reason to explore more puzzles
- Refresh the mental model and encourage broader puzzle exploration without disrupting the daily routine

## Goals

- Boost clears per day beyond the core 3 puzzles
- Drive session time and engagement through improved puzzle visibility
- Improve LTV through higher ad impressions and in-app purchases

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was that the third daily puzzle drew all user attention, reducing interaction with the featured section. Players were unaware of or unmotivated to try other puzzles due to visual clutter, lack of incentive, and unclear labeling.

Key learnings included:

- UX redesign must consider visual hierarchy and player motivations (e.g., streaks, freshness)
- Simplifying puzzle choices reduces decision fatigue (paradox of choice)
- Social proof, reset timers, and fun naming conventions can subtly boost interest and FOMO
- Mimicking the visual style of daily puzzles increased familiarity and ease of adoption

## Outcome

- Engagement with "Today's Top Picks" increased to 68% of eligible DAUs
- Puzzle clears/day improved significantly, with more players solving 5+ puzzles daily
- Session time up by 6%, net revenue up by 4.9%
- LTV for this feature exceeded expectations, showing a measurable 2.21% lift
- Visual and behavioral refresh helped reposition the featured section as a core engagement driver

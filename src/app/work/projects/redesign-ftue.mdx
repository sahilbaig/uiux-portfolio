## About the game

Wordy is a casual, free-to-play word game launched in August 2022. It has garnered over 1 lakh downloads and maintains a daily active user base of 40k+ players. The FTUE redesign aimed to streamline onboarding and improve engagement for new users.

## Objectives

- Identify usability and engagement issues in the current FTUE flow
- Improve clarity and reduce cognitive load during onboarding
- Create a more engaging and goal-driven experience to encourage retention

## Goals

- Reduce early-stage drop-offs (especially 14% at instructions and 48% at puzzle 2)
- Increase the number of players completing the FTUE flow and puzzle 2
- Boost Day 0 session time and early retention through better onboarding

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was maintaining a balance between guidance and player autonomy. The original flow was either too hand-holdy or completely hands-off. We learned that:

- Progressive assistance across puzzles works better than frontloading instructions
- Clear visual hierarchy and reduced distractions significantly improve user clarity
- Cognitive load needs to be managed with minimal text and guided interactions

## Outcome

- 30% more players completed FTUE and Puzzle 2 without friction
- Day 0 session time increased by 4.5%
- 2x increase in first puzzle clearers (from 33% to 66%)
- Funnel improved across all major checkpoints, contributing to better retention and increased LTV
